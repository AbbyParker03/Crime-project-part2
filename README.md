# Crime-project-part2

~ Introduction 

This is a pipeline that reads in a number of files associated with crime in Essex, Avon and Somerset, Cleveland and the West Midlands from June 2022 to June 2024. It is designed to process and analyze crime and housing data in a structured manner.
It is divided into three distinct layers:

- Staging

- Primary 

- Reporting

Each layer performs specific tasks to clean, transform, and aggregate data to support detailed reporting and analysis. 

The staging layer is responsible for the initial ingestion and preparation of raw data. This involves: Ingesting data, cleaning data and saving data. 

In the primary layer the staged data is transformed for deeper analysis. This involves: Data transformation, Feature extraction and saving the transformed data 

The reporting layer is the final stage where the processed data is used to generate actionable insights. This involves: Merging data, Aggregating data and producing CSV's that can be used to make visulisations. 

The pipeline can be executed in full or specific stages based on the users needs. Each stage builds upon the previous one, ensuring a strucutred flow from raw data ingestion to insightful reporting.
